# FoundationFS

FoundationFS is a File Storage system for FoundationDB written in go
intended to mimic mongodb gridfs file storage layer.

Includes an example http server interface with support for basic upload and download of any file type.


## Status

Since FoundationDB is no longer publicly available, I've decided to take the source for FoundationFS
down. If you're interested in using it in a legacy environment, drop me a line at mike@cloudmo.de. In
the meantime, congrats to the FoundationDB team in their new "mission".
